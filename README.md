## 📖 Biography & Impact

I am currently a **Researcher** and **Doctoral Supervisor** at the School of Software Technology, **Zhejiang University**, where I lead the **SPAIL (System Performance Analytics and Intelligence Lab)**.

My career spans nearly **30 years** at the forefront of computer system performance, bridging the gap between hardware architecture and hyperscale software deployment. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the **University of Washington** (1996), studying under ACM/IEEE Fellow David Notkin.

Before returning to academia in 2023, I held senior technical leadership roles at two of the world's most influential technology companies:
*   **Chief Scientist** at **Alibaba** (2016–2022)
*   **Principal Engineer** at **Intel (USA)** (1996–2016)

### 🚀 Economic & Industry Impact
Throughout my career, I have focused on **Software-Hardware Co-optimization (SHCO)** and **System Performance Analytics**. The optimization technologies and methodologies I led have generated an **accumulated economic benefit of over $20 Billion USD** for the industry, optimizing millions of servers globally from the P6 microarchitecture era to the "Double 11" cloud scale.

### 🌐 Global Authority
*   **JCP-EC Member:** I served as the **first and only Chinese representative** on the **Java Community Process Executive Committee (JCP-EC)** (2018–2022), the highest decision-making body for global Java standards.
*   **Standards & Patents:** I hold **42 patents** (including 24 US patents) and have published over **135 papers**.
